Bugs
====

- Floating orientation doesn't combine well with object rotation.

Features
========

- Object sizing options (Normal, ScalePreservingAspect, ScaleToFit).
- Object rotation should continue when pan releases above a certain speed.
- Gestures strength should be consistent across screen sizes.

Build
=====

- Add shaders to resources build.
- Replace buildshaders.py with encryptshaders.py.
- Move SGLKitResources files into SGLKit folder?

Future
======

- Switch math to GLM?
- Assign textures to samplers using a stack or index?
- Take another stab at using the preprocessor to autogenerate uniforms in glsl and objc.
